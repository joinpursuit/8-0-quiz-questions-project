**Q:** What would be the output of the code below?
```js
let puppies = ["Nova", "Bowie", "Piper", "Pupper"];
puppies[1] = "Biscuit";
```

> The `Output` of the code above shows would replace the string of ``` "Bowie" ``` with the string of ``` "Biscuit" ``` in place of it, ultimately completely removing "Bowie" from the array. To further understand this research index[i] positions.

**Q:** What is the definition of an Array and how is it used in Javascript?

> The `Definition` of an Array is that it provides a more effecient way to store data by keeping items or things in one place. Arrays allow us to store multiple, seperate variables in one place (array). Arrays are created using ['square brackets']. Values are stores in between these brackets using commas.

**Q:** How do we go about accessing values in a given object?

> `Values` in an object are accessed using brackets. The string that you place inside a bracket following the object will return the value of the matching key.

```
Example: 
const actress = {
    firstName: "Shareeka",
    lastName: "Epps",
};
const firstName = actress["firstName"];
console.log(firstName);
```

The above example shows an object, the string "Shareeka" -firstName being accessed using [] bracket notation, which will print Shareeka.
