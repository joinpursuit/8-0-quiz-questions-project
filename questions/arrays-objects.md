## Arrays & Objects:

### 1) What is a multidimensional array ?

```
Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain arrays as their elements. If an array is filled with arrays it is considered to be 2 dimensional (also often referred to as a matrix). If those arrays are also filled with arrays it becomes a 3 dimensional array or multidimensional. Typically it is bad practice to go further than 2 dimensional arrays.
```

### 2) How would someone index into a multidimensional array ?

```
The indexing pattern of using brackets '[ ]' with the desired index remains the same. However, if one want to access elements in an array within an array, we must then index again into that.
