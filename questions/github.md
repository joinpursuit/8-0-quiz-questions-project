**Q:** Why GitHub and not GitLab?
> `Github` became a widespread industry standard due to its <br> `built-in Continuous Integration/Delivery`<br> which saves a lot of time for `Software Development Teams` and provides `Quality Assurance`. <br>
Due to `GitHub` unveiling it's copilot program and it being shown to steal code <br>from copyrighted resources 
some companies are deciding whether or not to<br> move their repositories to local servers
or using an external CL service. <br>Other companies are waiting or don't care.
