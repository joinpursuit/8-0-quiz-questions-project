**Q:** What is the difference between `Git` and `Github` ?

> `Github` is a `Git` repository hosting service, while `Git`, `version control system` is a command line tool. `Github` provides a `web-based` graphical interface, it also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wiki and basic task management tools for every project.

**Q:** What are some benefits of using `Github` ?

> `Using Github has many benefits`, in the following lines i will enumerate some of them:   
1. `Github is a repository`, it allows our work to get out there in front of the public. It is one of the largest coding communities arount right now, so it's wide exposure for our projects. 
2. `Easy to contribute to our open source projects`, nearly each open source project uses Github to manage their project. Using Github is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in depth documentation and get feedback. To contribute, we just fork a project, make our changes and send a pull request using Github web interface.
3. `Documentation`, Github makes it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for almost any topic related to git.
4. `Showcase our work`, developers wish to attract recruiters and Github is the best tool that we can rely on. When searching for new recruits for their project, most compagnies look into github profiles. Having a github account gives us a higher chance of being recruited.
5. `Markdown`, allows us to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents. Github has revolutionized writing by channeling everything through `markdown`.
6. `Track changes in your code across versions`, when working in team, it's hard to keep track revisions. Github takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.  
Lastly, `integration options`, Github can integrate with common platforms such as Amazon and Google Cloud, services such as `Code Climate` to track your feedback and can `highlight syntax in more than 200 different programming languages`.

**Q:** In Github, what is the difference between a `project` and a `repository` ?

> Github introduced a new feature called `Projects` in 2016. This provide a visual board that is typical of many Project Management tools:
* A `repository` is the most basic element of Github. They're easier to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either `public` or `private`.
* `Project` boards on Github help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create project boards for specific feature work, comprehensive roadmaps, or even release checklists. With projects boards, you have the flexibility to create customized workflows that suit your needs.   
**Note:**
* When it comes to a regular `project`, we can have multiple repositories per project. For instance, if we have a client/server application, we only have one project. But we can have a repository for the client and a repository for the server. We need to define well which term `(project)` we're talking about.
