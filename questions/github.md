***Question 1:***
What is the stark difference between GitHub and Git?

>Answer: While Git can be used on a local repository on you computer without internet access, GitHub is a service that needs internet access for most of the features to be used. It also allows for collaboration remotely between people due to its purpose and makes coding collaboratively easier.

***Question 2:***
How do you clone in GitHub?

>Answer: Before cloning, you have to change directories and make sure you aren't in a git repository, make sure the directory you change to is the parent directory of where you want to put the repository and you don't have a directory that doesn't have the same name of the repository you're going to clone. Once you are sure, go to GitHub, hit the green code button and copy the web address that appears there. On the command line in your terminal, type `git clone <url>` and press enter to add it to your computer.

What three commands can you use to push your code into your GitHub repository?

>Answer: `git remote add origin <url>`, `git branch -M main` and `git push -u origin main`.
