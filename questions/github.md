## Question 1. GitHub vs. Git
```
- GitHub is a graphical user interface service and is hosted on the web (global access), maintained by Microsoft. Git 

is a software installed on a local or personal computer system (local access), maintained by Linux.
```
## Question 2. How can you protect your code on GitHub? 
```
- By changing repository settings to private or if it's public, do not include login credentials and other highly 

sensitive information in code accessible to the public. Even though your work comes with no permissions, someone 

cannot legally use any part of your project in their code, unless permission is given. 
```
## Question 3. Does GitHub have a mascot?
```
- Yes. She, yes she is an Octocat created by the same creator of the Twitter bird.
