# Github

**Question #1**
```
What command do we run in our CLI when we want to push our project from our local repository to our remote repository?
```
**Answer**
```js
$Git push
```
```
After we stage our files using $ Git add and commit them using $ git commit we can then upload all local branch commits to Github using $ Git push
```
**Question #2**
```
How do we experiment and make changes to an existing project without affecting the original repository?
```
**Answer**
```
Forking a project on Github is the most common way that we can create changes , edit & build on existing projects without affecting the original project. Once we fork a copy onto our profile we can then clone the forked repository onto our machines where you will be free to make all the changes and optimizations needed.
```
**Question #3**
```
What is Version Control and why is it important?
```
**Answer**
```
Each file that we upload onto github has a history(save point) that allows us to easily explore changes that occurs at different times. Version Control allows us to keep track of our work and allows us to access different versions of our files that we've created. Think of github as a cloud based server that stores all of our information safely that we can access later when we want our colleagues/ team to access them and make changes later on down the road.
