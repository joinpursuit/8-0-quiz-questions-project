**Q1:** What is the difference between cloning a file with its HTTP address vs SSH method?

> As far as security goes, the SSH key is more effective and once initally set up, also faster. Assuming you have a password, the HTTPS method will prompt you to authenticate yourself all throughout git and usage of its commands. It can also stay secure in the event that you want to share your code with someone else, they wouldn't need to know your personal password, just your private SSH key.

**Q2:** What does it mean to create a pull request? What does the original repository owner see?

> A pull request is akin to asking for your changes to be approved. Lines that you've added to the original unmodified code will be displayed in green, and lines that you've removed will be displayed in red. Pull requests are necessary because they allow the code's owner to keep track of the changes being submitted to them since it's possible that they are receiving multiple versions. It keeps code submissions organized and prevents code being unwantingly  overwritten.

**Q3:** What is the difference between forking a repository and cloning a repository and what is the relationship to GitHub?

> Forking a repository directly involves the use of GitHub to take a copy of someone else's repository without altering it to be able to work on it independently. However, it will not be able to be taken offline to your local computer without cloning it to a local space. A cloned repository on a computer will be synced between local and online, and be connected through the use of push and pull.
