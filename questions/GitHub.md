> ## **What is GitHub?**
```
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.
```
> ## **What is the name of the location where all the files for a particular project are stored?**
```
A repository (repo for short) is the location where all of the files will be stored.  Each project will have its own repo that can be accessed with a unique URL.
```
> ## **When you create a new project based off of another project that already exists on GitHub, that is called:**
```
Forking.  This allows us to make changes to the repo and release the revised project as a new repo. 
```
> ## **Repositories are folders that contain changes called:**
```
Commits, which are intentional snapshots of progress.
```
> ## **After revising projects, how do we include the changes into the official repository?**
```
By generating a pull request, we allow authors of the original project to see our work, and from there they will choose whether or not add these changes to the original repository.
```
