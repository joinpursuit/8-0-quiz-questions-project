# Arrays and Objects

***Question 1:***
How would you show the dot notation and bracket notation of this example:

```js
let pursuitFellow = {name: 'Trevor'}
```

```js
pursuitFellow.name

pursuitFellow['name']
```
>Answer: In the above example, `pursuitFellow` is a variable with a key represented by `name` and a value of `Trevor`. The above answer shows with dot notation the object `pursuitFellow` followed by a dot `.` and the property `name`.  The bracket notation shows the object `pursuitFellow` surrounding the property `'name'`  with square brackets `[]` and quotes `''`.
