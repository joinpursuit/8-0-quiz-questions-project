    Object is a collection of key/value pairs. It has no length.What matters again is a key/value pair to store data inside.
    obj{}

    An array value can be accessed using index. We have to specify the name of an array and index number that is put in a square bracket.Note: index of an array always  starts with 0.

.unShift - adds value to the beginning
.shift - removes the elements from the beginning of an array
