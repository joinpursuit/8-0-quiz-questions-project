> ## **What is the difference between Git & GitHub?**

```
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Much like the "Save" feature on a local document, Git creates a snapshot of your project that you can return to, or share with others, anytime. Git is utilized on the command line to execute commands. 

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service that provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as forking, pull requests and merge.

> ## **To make a directory, or folder, which command do we use? What does the command stand for?**

```
'mkdir' command is used to create a folder, which stands for 'make directory'.

Ex:  mkdir newFolder

newFolder is now the name of the new directory. 

```
> ## **To make a new file within a folder, which command do we use?**
```
'touch' command is used to create new files within folders.

Ex:  touch newfile.md
```
> ## **Which command is used to move into a new folder or directory? What does it stand for?**
``` 
`cd` is the command used to 'change directory' into a new folder.

Ex: cd newFolder

Will change the directory into the defined folder, in this case, 'newFolder'.
```
> ## **How else can the change directory command be used?**
```
The change directory command, or `cd ~`, can also be used to bring us back to our home location on the command line.

Ex: cd ~

will bring us back to 'home' , as evidenced by the ~ symbol 

'cd ..` is used to move into the previous directory, one folder at a time.
```
> ## **What command is used to list the file contents of a directory? What command is used to list 'hidden' files?**
```
'ls' is used to list contents of a directory, whereas 'ls -a' is used to list all files in a directory including hidden ones.
```

'git init' command initializes a repository
```
> ## **How do we check status of our files, add changes, and commit changes to our repo using Git?**
```
To check status we use :  git status
To add changes we use : git add (filename)
To commit changes we use :  git commit -m"we enter comments within quotes"
