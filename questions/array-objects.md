## Question 1. Why do Objects represent a special data type and Arrays are a special type of variable?
```
- Objects represent "things" with properties (characteristics) while Arrays create and store lists of data in a single 

variable. 
```
## Question 2. Do Arrays have methods?
```
- All methods of Objects can be invoked on Arrays. 
```
## Question 3. Which example is an Array and how can you tell? Which is an Object and how can you tell?
```js
- const car = {color:"Maroon", price:"$10,000", make:"Nissan", model:"Murano"}
 ```   
    The curly brackets and key:value pair represent an Object.
```js
- const car = ["Nissan", "$10,000", "Maroon", "Murano", "AWD"]
```
```
    The square brackets represent an Array.
