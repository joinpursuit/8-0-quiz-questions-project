Polya's technique has four discrete steps, that can be applied to problems that arise in both 
your day to day life and while writing code. What are the four steps of Polya's problem solving technique?
1. Understand the problem. 
    ask clarifying questions.
2. Devise a plan.
    once you have an understanding of the problem create multiple plans that can lead you to your desired output.
3. Solve it.
    now that you have understanding of the problem and mutliple plans, you should able to navigate towards a solution with confidence.
4. Reflect back.
    check for correctness and improvement.

What are the inputs and outputs of a problem?
Inputs refer to what information you will have in order to solve the problem. 
Outputs refer to what kind of result is needed.
