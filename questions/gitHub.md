**Q:** What is `GitHubs` forking feature?

> `GitHub` **"forking”** feature is copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.

**Q:** What are `GitHub` most powerful features?

> These three features **fork**, **pull** request and **merge** – are what make `GitHub` so powerful. Before `GitHub`, if you wanted to contribute to an open source project you had to manually download the project’s source code, make your changes locally, create a list of changes called a **“patch”** and then e-mail the patch to the project’s maintainer. The maintainer would then have to evaluate this patch, possibly sent by a total stranger, and decide whether to merge the changes.

**Q:** When you submit a pull request in `GitHub` what happens?

> When you submit a pull request, the project’s maintainer can see your profile, which includes all of your contributions on `GitHub`. If your patch is accepted, you get credit on the original site, and it shows up in your profile. It’s like a resume that helps the maintainer determine your reputation. The more people and projects on `GitHub`, the better idea picture a project maintainer can get of potential contributors. Patches can also be publicly discussed.
