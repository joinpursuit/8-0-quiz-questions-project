# GitHub Questions

**Q** How would you put your work on `GitHub` from your local terminal?

>in order to get your code on `GitHub` you would have to first be in the main branch of the repository that you want to add, then run the command `$git add .` which adds everything in said repository or `$git add sample.md` which adds just one file. You can check the status to make sure that it is saved with `$git status`, then you have to commit your file with the command `$git commit -m "put comment here"`. Finally you have to push your repositories to git using the command `$git push`.
