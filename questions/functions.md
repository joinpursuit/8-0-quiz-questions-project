# Working the Function
**Q:** How does console.log versus return affect a function?
> Console.log in a function allows users to read the results of a function by printing information to the console. Console.log allows the computer to communicate the function to the user. Return allows a function to output a value when a function is called. Return allows the computer to communicate the function to with itself.

**Q:** What is the difference when using primitive and non primitive parameters in a function?

> Primitive parameters are parameters where information stored as the value. Examples of primitive parameter are numbers, strings, and or booleans. In functions, primitive values can change due to the series of steps set within a function. The change is not set outside of the function. It is not available in a global scople. On the other hand, non primitive parameters such as arrays, can have their properties changed due to the function. With that being the case, the updated parameter can exist outside of the function, retaining a global scope.

**Q:** Should you create a function with a let, var or a const?
> If it is let, then it can be reassigned and that could be a serious problem.  We should NEVER use var! Therefore it should be a const.  We should not be able to reassign something as important as a const.
