**Question #2** How would you call this _JavaScript_ function?

```js
function owl(){
    return "The owl can turn it's head 270 degrees.";
};
```
 1. owl();
 2. owl;
 3. function owl();
 4. console.log(owl);

>**Answer**: The answer is  `owl();`. This is the proper way to call this _JavaScript_ function.

**Question #3** If the arguments (20,5) were given, what would be the correct result?
```js
function add(a,b){
  return a%b;

}
add()

```
 1. 5;
 2. 0;
 3. 4;
 4. 25;


>**Answer**: The answer is `0`. When we pass the arguments `(20,5)`, `5` goes in to `20` four times, leaving no remainder, therefore it being `0`.
