Q: What is a "function"?

    A: A function is a set of statements or procedures that performs a task or calculation after taking some input to return an output value. To use a function you must define it somewhere within the scope from which you wish to call it.

Q: What are the different parts of a function?

    A: There are four parts to a function: 
        1. The function keyword
        2. An optional name (this is because it can be anonymous)
        3. A list of parameters names enclose in parentheses.
        4. The statement enclosed in braces.
        ex: function optionalName(parameter){
            return parameter;
        }

Q: What is invocation?

    A: Functions execute when the function is called. This process is known as invocation. You can invoke a function by referencing the function name, followed by an open and closed parentheses: ().
