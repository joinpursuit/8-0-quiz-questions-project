# Functions Questions and Answers

**Q:** Why are `functions` imporant part of JavaScript, why do we use them?

> A: `Functions` are used to avoid repetitiveness while coding. They are useful tools for scalable problems. 
For example, trying to get the average grade of each student would require a lot of work, but using one `function` we would be able to calculate any number of students' grades.

**Q:** What are `helper functions` and why do we use them?

> A: Just like a program without functions turn repetitive, the code inside functions can also become repitious, that is when helper functions come in. "A helper function is a function that performs part of the computation of another function" [web.cs.wpi.edu](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs1101/a05/Docs/creating-helpers.html)

**Q:** What is the role of `return` in a `function`, and how is it different from using `console.log` when used inside a function?

> A: `Return` takes the role of an output in a `function` or its value is the output, and `return` is the tool for the output coming out of the function. That output can be stored in a variable and reused if needed. It is common to declare a variable and store the evaluated result of invoking a function definition, in other words, function's `return` output.
`console.log` only prints a value within a function to the console, and we can see the output there, and that is all it does. It doesn't return or store a value to outside a `function`.
