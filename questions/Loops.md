# Loops

### 1. **What is a while loop?**

A While loop is a loop used to check for a certain value or argument to be true. As long as that value/argument is true, it will keep the loop running.

**Example:**

```js
let grape = 1;
while (grape < 20) {
    console.log('I have this many grapes:' + grape);
    grape += 1;

}

```

### 2. **What is a for loop?**

A for loop is a loop used to create a variable, check a certain condition and then change the value of whatever statement is provided.

**Example:**

```js

for (grape = 1; grape < 10; grape++) {
    console.log(grape);
}


```


### 3. **Why are loops useful?**

Loops are useful because loops allow you to write code that will carry out a reptitive like function for you, without writing multiple lines of code.
