> ## **___ are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.**  

```
Loops execute a block of code a number of times based on a condition. 
```
> ## **What is the condition that stops the tasks from being performed?**

```
A loop will continue to execute until the defined condition is false.
```

``` 
The 'for' loop consists of initialization, condition, final expression and a statment.  

An initialization expression is commonly used to create counters and is run before the first execution on the loop.

The condition expression is checked prior to the execution of every iteration. If omitted, this expression evaluates to true & the loopâ€™s statement is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops.

The final expression is run after every iteration. It can be used to increment or  decrement a counter.

The statement is the code to be repeated in the loop.

Ex: 

for ([initialization]); [condition]; [final-expression]) {
   // statement
}
```
> ## **Which statement can be used to exit the loop before the condition expression evaluates to false?**
```
The break statement can be used to "jump out" of a loop.
