Question 1. Do I need Git to access GitHub?

- You do not need GitHub to access Git, but you cannot access GitHub without using Git. 

Question 2. What does rm -rf do to a file or directory from the command line as opposed to just putting the file in the trash from Mac Book Finder Window?

- rm -rf from the command line will permanently delete a file or directory and all its contents. Sending a file or directory to the trash from the Finder Window will not. Only after the trash is emptied will it be permanently deleted. 

Question 3. What does this mean from the command line "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

- Git status result. Means there is nothing staged/unstaged to be commited.
