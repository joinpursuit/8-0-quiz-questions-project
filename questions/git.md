***Question 1:***
How do you make a directory in a terminal?

Type `mkdir` and the name of the directory you want to create.

>Answer: Make sure you are in the directory you want to be in first.  This keeps your directories organized and leads to less confusion later.  In my case, `/Users/trevortriumph` is my home directory. But I will change  directories to `/Users/trevortriumph/Documents/8-0` to make this new directory to keep my folders organized by typing this into the command line or pressing tab if I typed it previously or even toggling with my up arrow key on my keyboard.  When I do that, `8-0` should be in the command line. From there, I can type `mkdir <file name>` to create a new directory and to make it easier to find what I just created.

***Question 2:***
How do you add changes into a repository?

>Answer: After adding new information into a repsoitory, you need to type `git add <filename>` into the command line of the terminal and press enter.  Afterwards, you need to commit the file to Git and write a short commit message discussing the change by writing `git commit -m "comment about the change"` in the command line.

***Question 3:***
What can `cd` do in Git?

>Answers: By typing `cd` in to the command line of your terminal, you can change directories to your Home directory. By typing `cd(/'folder name')`, you can navigate to whatever available folder in your computer. Also, by typing `cd ..`, you can leave the parent directory of the current directory you are inside of.
