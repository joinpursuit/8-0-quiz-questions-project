 **Q** How can you clone your repository from github onto your local machine?

 > Assuming you have git installed, open your terminal, navigate to your git and change directories to the one you want to place your clone in. <br>
 Then login to your Github account, click on your icon at the top right, click on your repositories, navigate to the desired repository, and click on it. <br>
 You should then see a button with an arrow on it that says code. <br>
 Click on that and you should see a url. <br> You can manually copy it or at the end of text input there is button <br>(that resembles an old floppy disc) you can click on to copy the url to your clipboard.
<br>
Go back to your terminal and type `git clone` then `press space` then `paste your url` <br> with `command + v` on `Mac` or `ctrl + v` on `Windows` or enter your url `manually`.
