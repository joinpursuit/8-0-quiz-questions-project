**Q:** Why is the verison control system so important and why must use's `Git` for it?

> `Git` is the most popular *version control system* in the world. A version control system records the changes made to our code over time in a special database called a *repository*. We can look at our project history and see who has made what changes when and why and if we screw something up we can easily revert our project back to an earlier state. Without a *version control system* we'll have to constantly store copies of the entire project in various folders. This is very slow and doesn't scale at all especially if mutiple people have to work on the same project, you would have to constantly toss around the latest code via email or some other device and then manually merge the changes. So in a nutshell with a *version control system* we can track project history and work together. Out of all those *verison control system* out there, `Git`'s is the most used one cause its free open source, super fast, and scalable plus opertaions like branching and merging are also very fast.

**Q:** who invented Git?

> *Linus Torvalds* invented `Git` in 2005 for him in order to continue development of the *Linux Kernel* cause his team could no longer advance with the other software. Fun fact tibit *Linus Torvalds* is also the creator of *Linux*.  
___

**Q:** Why did Linus Torvalds created `Git`?

> Due to the lack of specific requirements for a distributed system that he and his team needed along with the relationship between *Linux Kernel* and the company that created BitKeeper broke down, *Linus* took up the challenge to create one much better then **Bitkeeper** and within a week `Git` was born. He wanted the `Git` software to be fast with a simple design that had strong support for non-linear development and is fully distributed to hand large projects like the *Linux Kernel* efficiently. Since then `Git` has matured to be easy to use and taken pair programming in a new direction such as social coding among programmers.
