Q: What is an array?

    A: An array provides a convenient way to store a collection of data all in one place. So for a series of numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, and 11) instead of creating five separate variables we can create an array to store all these values. To create an array, we use the [ and ] square brackets, and in between put whatever values we need separated by commas. 
        ex: let arr = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
