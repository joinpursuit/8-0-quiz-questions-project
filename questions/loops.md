# Loops

**Q:** Write a for loop that will cycle through the following array:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

> `for(let i=0; i<arr.length; i++){}`

---

**Q:** Write a while loop that logs the numbers from 1 to 35.

> `let num = 1;
while (num <= 35) {
  console.log(num);
  num += 1;
}`

---

**Q:** What would be used in a loop to stop it from running once a certain condition was met?

```js
const temperatureInCelsius = 30;
if (temperatureInCelsius > 25)
  console.log("It is very hot today!");
}
```

> The term `break` would be used. It causes the loop to stop running once the condition that is outlined in the code is met.

**Q:** What is the purpose of a loop?
