**What is loop and why do we use it?**
```
    Loops are used for repeatedly run a code block each time with a different value until desired conditions are met.
```
**What is the difference between for and while loops?**
```
    A for loop will run a preset amount of times whether a while loop will run a varibale number of times and it uses a conditional.
```
**Can you do a nested loop?**
```
Yes, you can, just change the variable.
For example:

for(var i =0;i<3; i++){
    for(var j =0; j<5; i++){
    }
 }
```
