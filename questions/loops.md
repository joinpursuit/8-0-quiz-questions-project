## Question 1. Can you use a "for" loop without a condition expression? 
```
- Yes, Of course you can. An empty condition is taken to evaluate to 1 or True. Use of a break statement needed to exit 

the loop.
```
## Question 2. Which loop is guaranteed to execute at least once?
```
- Any loop will only get executed if its condition is true. As far as the for loop and the while loop both will check 

a condition before a body is executed and they will NEVER get executed if a condition is false. The only loop that 

will always get executed at least once, is the "do while" loop. The condition is not evaluated until you reach the end of a loop. 
```
## Question 3. What do the following expressions of a for loop represent?
  ```
  üëâüèæ index < array.length 
        
        conditional
  
  üëâüèæ index++ 
        
        increment
  
  üëâüèæ let index = 0 
        
        initial 
```
