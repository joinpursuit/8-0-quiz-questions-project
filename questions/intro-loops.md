**Q:** Write the basic syntax for a `for loop` and explain in plain english how it works.

> 
```
for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++ ){
    console.log(i);
}
```
> For the above code, the for statement declares the value of i and the sets it equal to 0 to start. Then it checks that i is less than or equal to 9, and then increments i by 1 every time the statement loops.

**Q:** What are the different types of `for loops` and why is it used?

> A loop is used to perform a function. Also known as `iterate` or repeat. 
> Two different types of for loops commonly used are: `for()loop` and a `while()loop`. A for loop is used when you know how many times you want it to run, and a while loop is used when you don't know how many times it will run.

**Q:** What are the 3 most important things needed for a for loop?

> Iterator 

> Conditionals 

> Stop ðŸ›‘ (how to change between each loop)

> Examples:
```
 for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++);{
    console.log(i);
}
```

```
let work = 0;
while(hours < 10){
    console.log(hours);
}
count ++
```
