> ## **What is a javascript function?**

```
A JavaScript function is a block of reuseable code designed to perform a particular task.
In other programming languages, a function is similar to a routine or subroutine.
```

```
Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition.
Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions.
```
> ## **Name the two kinds of arguments that are passed into a function.**

```
Primitive and object are two kinds of arguements passed as inputs to a function.
```

```
A `parameter` is a named variable passed into a function. These are found within the parentheses after the function name.

An `argument` is a value that is passed as input to a function. These are found within the parentheses after the function name when the function is called or outside of the declared function.

> ## **How are functions defined?**
```
The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.

Ex: 

function printHello(){

    console.log ('Hello!');

}
