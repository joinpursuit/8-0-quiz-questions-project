# Functions

**How would you declare a `Function`?**
``` js
Function functionName(parameters){
   //what the function does

    return 
}
```
You write out the word function, give it a name and parameter(s)(parameters go inside the parentheses). Create open and closed curly brackets and in here is the function body. The function body defines what the function does. And you return the desired output.
