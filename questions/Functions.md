# Functions

**1. How would you declare a `Function`?**
``` js
function functionName(parameters){
   //what the function does

    return 
}
```
You write out the word function, give it a name and parameter(s)(parameters go inside the parentheses). Create open and closed curly brackets and in here is the function body. The function body defines what the function does. And you return the desired output.  

**2. How do you call a function?**

You write the name of the function and you put the parameter you want to pass through the function inside parentheses. Let's use the function above as an example: 

``` js
functionName(parameters)

```

**3. What's wrong with the following function? (Note: the function is already declared)**

``` js 
functionName{}
    

```
This function won't work because there's no parentheses, empty or otherwise. Function syntax requires parentheses. (Note: the function is already declared)
