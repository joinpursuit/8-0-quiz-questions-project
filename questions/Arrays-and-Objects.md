> ## **Which data structure is used specifically to store a sequence of values?**

```
Arrays are used in JavaScript to store a sequence of values. 
```
> ## **Which data types can arrays contain?**

```
JavaScript arrays can contain numbers, strings, boolean, objects and other arrays.
```
> ## **Values in an array are called ___ .   How are they notated?**
``` 
Values in an array are called elements.  Elements are defined within square brackets, separated by a comma.

Ex:  Let arr =[2,4,6,8];
```
> ## **Each element has a numeric postion in an array, also known as its:**
```
Index value 
```
> ## **The index value in an array starts at:**
```
Zero
```
> ## **The final index position of an array is equal to:**
```
The length of the array - 1 

Ex:  finalIndexPosition = arr.length-1
```
> ## **Dynamic collections of key value pairs in Javascript are called:**

```
Objects. They are used in JavaScript to store key values and more complex entities. 
```
> ## **What data type are objects considered, and how do they compare to other data types?**

```
Objects are considered reference data types. Reference data types, as opposed to primitive data types (which store values), point to the location in memory where objects are stored.
```
> ## **Which is the most common method to create objects?**
``` 
Objects can be created using curly brackets {}, with the keys or property names separated from values with a : 

Ex:  Let object = { key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3} ;
```
> ## **Which notations are used to access values within objects?**
```
Values inside objects can be accessed using dot or bracket notation.

Ex: object.key1 = value1 = object[key]
