# Git 
**1. In short, what is the use for git?**
Git is a version control system. It is software that is used to track changes in files by helping the user to document various versions of the file. Git is useful for documenting your work process, accessing older versions of your work, and it is very helpful for collaborative programming. 

**2. How does git save file changes compared to a word-processor like microsoft word?**

Git does not automatically save any of your work. Git is meant to be used very deliberately, and the user gets to decide what precisely is documented as a saved version. Git easily allows a user to compare versions of the file against each other, which is a helpful feature, and it timestamps when various changes were made. 

Microsoft word, on the other hand, utilizes auto-save by default, and is only preserving the latest version of the document since the last save. It is not as effective at documenting the work process. 


**3. What are the three magic git commands, and what do they do?**
```
git add 
git commit 
git push 
```
"git add" will add the file you're working with to the staging area, meaning it will solidify the current version and make it ready to be documented and saved.

"git commit" will officially save the file and its details, and gives you the option of including a relevant comment. 

"git push" will push the file and its associated information to a remote repository, such as GitHub.
