# Git

* ### What is the difference between **git add** and **git commit**?
  
  * Both command lines are used to modify the changes made in a file or directory, **git add** modifies the untracked or unstaged files and places the file in a staged area and **git commit** keeps a permanent track of the modifications made to the file associated with a message that is represented by **-m**.

* ### What is the difference between **git diff** and **git status**?

  * The command line **git diff** is used to see the changes made in between commits, the unstaged changes in the current directory. The command line **git status** is used to see if the changes have been staged or haven't, if there were any changes made to the files in the current directory.

* ### How can we check the history of our local repository?

  * If we need to go through the changes or modifications made in a repository we can use **git log**, it allows us to track the history of commits made to a repository.
