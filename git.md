# What is Git?!

As does often occur, a [song](https://music.apple.com/us/album/what-is-hip/287826674?i=287826734) pops into my head when certain words, phrases or questions bring them to mind. In this case, Tower of Power's incredible, "What is Hip" has me dancing down to the notion of "What is Git," so I invite you, the reader, to the [party going on inside my head](https://media.giphy.com/media/xT1R9QiEgcUlPzE2pq/giphy.mp4) just to `Git` into (no pardon being asked for the pun) the spirit of Git, and all its glory.

Git is software, first and foremost. It's a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) which means it manages, tracks and controls changes where computer programs, large web platforms, smaller websites, documents, or really any collection of digital information is concerned. Originally developed in 2005 by one [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) (also creator of the Linux operating system core), Git is open source (freely available and publicly maintained), evolved, trusted and relied upon by a staggering number of software projects-commercial or otherwise, as it functions on a wide range of [Integrated Development Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDEs).

# Why Git?

Performance, security, flexibility, speed, data integrity, and support namely. Having a distributed architecture as opposed to one single place for the full version history, means a developer can make fast, reliable changes to source code without network access and their working copy of code is a repository containing every single change ever made. Another thing that sets Git apart is its [branching model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). New branches are created when changes are made, allowing teams to make revisions without overwriting each other's work.

## Performance, Security and Flexibility

Git's raw performance characteristics are optimized and solid even where their competitors are concerned. Due to long-standing use, Algorithms enforced inside of Git have deep knowledge about attributes of real source code file trees, how they're modified over time and what their access patterns are.

In other words, Git is great at determining what the storage and version history of the file tree should be as it focuses on the file content and not the file's extensions. Its repository files are object formatted using delta encoding (storing content differences), version metadata (directory contents) and compression.

Its source code is secured with the SHA1 hashing algorithm which protects changes to the code and ensures its history is authentic and fully traceable.

Its compatibility and integration with existing systems and protocols, trusted project maintainers, deep level of tracking and large talent pool make it the standard.

# Why Not Git and What are the Alternatives?

- Git can be challenging to learn and does not track renames
- Its terminology sometimes conflicts with other VCSs

## Alternatives:

As it turns out, Git alternatives are plentiful. You may refer to each link to discover what each of their value propositions are. Here is a shortlist of the forerunners:
