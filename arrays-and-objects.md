# Arrays & Objects

**1. How do you declare an array variable?**
You write a const or a let variable declaration, give it a name, and you put two square brackets. For example:

``` js
let arr = []
```
These two brackets will make sure that JavaScript reads the variable as an array type. 

**2. Why are arrays useful for handling large amounts of data?**
Arrays can be useful in this regard because they can organize data that is relevant to each other. That data can be easily searched through using array methods which are native to JavaScript. They can also easily be manipulated using methods, meaning you can update the values of various objects within an array. They are versatile, powerful, and effective.

**3. Are objects common in JavaScript? Explain their use and whether theyâ€™re important to JavaScript.**
Nearly everything in JavaScript is an object. Objects are integral to how JavaScript works. All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects (source: W3 Schools). (Primitive values have no properties or methods, and they are immutable.) 

Objects are a way to store named values. The syntax uses key/value pairs. For example: 

```js
const obj = {
    firstName: "Colin", 
    lastName: "Firth", 
    occupation: "actor"
    }
```
Note: the values of these keys are all string types, but they can contain other data types, such as number, for example.
