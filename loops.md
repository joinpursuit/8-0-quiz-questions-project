# Loops 

**Q1** What is a `Loop`?

> Loops are tools in the javascript language used to continually run code and check a condition. A code block will run if the condition returns true. The condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.

**Q2** What part of the `For Loop` is a counter?

> The answer is the `Condition.` The `Condition` is a counter which is used to tell how many time the loop should run.

---

**Q3** When using a `While Loop,`  what will happen if the condition is false?

> The `While Loop` will stop looping. The code will continue to loop only if the code is true.
