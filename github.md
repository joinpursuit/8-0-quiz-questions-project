#GitHub
**1. What is the difference between git and GitHub?**

Git is the version control system itself (created by the legendary Linus Torvald). GitHub is a product which hosts servers for your git data to be stored. GitHub allows users to create their own account, and share and collaborate on files with other programmers.

**2. How is GitHub is useful for working on teams?**

GitHub is useful for working on teams because it gives users a means for maintaining and updating code in a logical and transparent way. It operates with a set of rules and procedures for suggesting and making changes, and it can handle a massive number of developers on a single file. This makes it suitable for large organizations. 

**3. How would you access a file on someoneâ€™s github account, and how would you create your own local version for your computer?**

I would get the user's username to access their account, or that user would provide a specific URL to their repository. GitHub provides URLs for "cloning" a repository. Then I'd put this URL into my terminal and use it with the command "git clone".

Example: 

```
git clone www.GitHubURL.com
```
This command will use the URL to download the file from GitHub. Now the file exists locally on my machine, and, while identical to the other person's file, it is a different file, and now I can change the file however I'd like.
