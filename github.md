# Github

**Q1** What is `Github`?

> `Github` is a website created for software developers to collaborate remotely on projects. Furthermore, `Github` allows you to store your repository on their server, eliminating the risk of losing any progress on a project if something were to happen to your computer or laptop. Lastly, Other Developers can view and modify projects from anywhere in the world.
