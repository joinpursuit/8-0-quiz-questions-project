# Git!!

## What is Git and its usage?

 Git is a version control system. It allows users to make changes to their code, as well as revert to old versions of code. Git also allows multiple users to collaborate and merge their work onto the same project.



## Write a list of commands you can run in Git and describe what each command does.

```
$ mkdir git-test - This is creating a directory or folder called git-test
$ cd git-test - Allows you to go inside of the directory
$ touch README.md - touch allows you to create a file. A file called README.md was created.
```

## What does it mean to stage files? 

Staging files is when you add the changes you made to your computer, your local repository before you decide to commit your changes to your global/remote repository. You stage buy using git add <file>.
